## 📝 To Do / Future Improvements

* Implement authentication (Login / Signup)
* Add routing (e.g. show detail pages, categories, etc.)
* Integrate external APIs (e.g. fetch data from a “movies/shows” API)
* Make it fully responsive: mobile, tablet, desktop views
* Add animations / transitions for cards / hover states
* Improve performance (lazy loading images, code splitting)
